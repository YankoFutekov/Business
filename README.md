A business site theme i have created using HTML5/CSS3 & Materialize that is cross-platform responsive, featuring an interactive Java Script Logaritmic Chart, scrollspy feature, and scrollfire (removed in Materialize v1.0.0, R.I.P.). Again, i have added some basic form verification, fixed navbar that starts transparent and turns solid once the screen is off-set by 1500px from the top.
